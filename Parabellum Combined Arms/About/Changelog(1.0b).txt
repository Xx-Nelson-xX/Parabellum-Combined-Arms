<--------------------------------------- 1.0b(initial stage) -------------------------------------------->

	>Due no support for raider vehicles yet, so the initial stage will be mostly experimenting VF and utility vehicles with little to none offensive capability

	
Tweaks:
+Reduced the fuel consumpotion to mostly, half of the previous value, in practice the previous value is very harsh for caravan...
*rebalance Armor for Utility Vehicles, in theory, Shotgun Slug and Full size Rifle ammo should damage cars and bikes
