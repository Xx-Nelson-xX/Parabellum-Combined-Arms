A HSK Rimworld Add-on Mod

First thing first I would like to thank all the modder of Hardcore SK and modders who create mods for it, who showed me a brand new Rimworld experience and introduce me to the world of modding for Rimworld(Mainy HSK).

This mod started with the idea to fill HSK CE combat system, mainly to add more weapon variety to the basic ammo type, but the more I play with the combat system, the more fun stuff I found when modding it, so I decided to keep going with my modding capability and keep expanding the mod.
